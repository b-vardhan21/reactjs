# Component Based Architecture
React component architecture is a way of organizing React components into a reusable and maintainable structure. It's based on the idea of using components to build larger components, which can then be used to build even larger components. This allows you to create complex UIs with a lot of functionality without having to write a lot of code.

There are a few different ways to organize React components into an architecture. One popular way is to use a container/component pattern. This pattern involves creating two types of components: containers and components. Containers are responsible for managing the state of their child components and passing that state down to them. Components are responsible for rendering their own UI and handling user interaction.
